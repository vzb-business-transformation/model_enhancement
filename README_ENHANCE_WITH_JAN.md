# Model Enhancement for Improving Predictions

Based on model prediction errors, then use that improved model to predict Feb25 values. To enhance my model by incorporating Jan 25 feedback to improve the new data predictions. 

## Approach overview
1. **Error Analysis** Analyze where the model failed in Jan25 predictions
2. **Model Retraining** Update the model with Jan data included
3. **Using Jan25 for targeted feature engineering** Create features using error patterns
4. **Predict Feb data** Generate predictions for Feb25
